                    This webpage is a good example of visual hierarchy by doing a couple things. First it takes what would be most 
                    important (helping students to contact them for questions and to help them pay for tution) and they make them the first 
                    couple big buttons. Then they take those topics that aren't as important to new students when they are first starting (
                    for example where students can get their homework), and they stick them as smaller buttons closer to the bottom of the page.

                    Hick's law is all about when there is too much stuff on a page it takes the user a longer time to click on any buttons
                    or interact with the page. Familysearch takes into concideration this law very well by reducing the amount of inforamtion 
                    and interation on the page to just a simple statement and a button to begin searching your family tree. This makes the user 
                    have a quiker time clicking the button and moving on through the page.

                <p>
                    Fitt's law is about having buttons and other things that users interact with together if they are all similar. For example,
                    a developer would want to put the search button next to the search bar. This is to help the users experience to flow more, and
                    to reduce confusion. A good example is the amazon page. It makes sure it groups the search bar with the search button, and then it
                    groups all of the prodects that it sells at the bottom in another group.
